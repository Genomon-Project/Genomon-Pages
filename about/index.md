Salmon is a **wicked-fast** program to produce a highly-accurate,
transcript-level quantification estimates from RNA-seq data. Salmon achieves is
accuracy and speed via a number of different innovations, including the use of
lightweight alignments (accurate but fast-to-compute proxies for traditional
read alignments) and massively-parallel stochastic collapsed variational
inference. The result is a versatile tool that fits nicely into many differnt
pipelines. For example, you can choose to make use of our lightweight
alignments by providing Salmon with raw sequencing reads, or, if it is more
convenient, you can provide Salmon with regular alignments (e.g. computed with
your favorite aligner), and it will use the same wicked-fast, state-of-the-art
inference algorithm to estimate transcript-level abundances for your
experiment.

All you need to run Salmon is a FASTA file containing your reference
transcripts and a (set of) FASTA/FASTQ file(s) containing your reads.
Optionally, Salmon can make use of pre-computed alignments (in the form of a
SAM/BAM file) to the transcripts rather than the raw reads.

The *lightweight-alignment-based* mode of Salmon runs in two phases; indexing
and quantification. The indexing step is independent of the reads, and only
need to be run one for a particular set of reference transcripts. The
quantification step, obviously, is specific to the set of RNA-seq reads and is
thus run more frequently. For a more complete description of all available
options in Salmon, see below.

The *alignment-based* mode of Salmon does not require indexing. Rather, you can
simply provide Salmon with a FASTA file of the transcripts and a SAM/BAM file
containing the alignments you wish to use for quantification.
