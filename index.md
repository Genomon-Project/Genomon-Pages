Overview
--------

Genomon is a pipeline for analyzing cancer genome and RNA sequencing data.

The Genomon can perform sensitive and accurate detection of most types of genomic variants
(single nucleotide variants, short indels, mid-size (20bp - 300bp) indels and large scale structural variations),
and transcriptomic changes (gene fusions, aberrant splicing patterns),
and fairy good performance is demonstrated 
through [a large number of important cancer genome projects](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Ogawa%2C%20Seishi%5BAuthor%5D)%20AND%20Miyano%2C%20Satoru%5BAuthor%5D).


Genomon adopt efficient job scheduling framework that enables us easily analyzing several hundreds of 
genome and transcriptome sequencing data simultaneously.
Genomon is easy to install and after installing, 
users can start analysis just preparing simple sample configuration files.

Also, Genomon can be easily extensible and developers can freely re-distribute throught GPLv3 license,
