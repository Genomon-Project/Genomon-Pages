Overview
--------

Genomon is a pipeline for analysisng cancer genome and RNA sequencing data.

For DNA sequencing analysis, Genomon performs sensitive and accurate detect of
most types of genomic variants (not only single nucleotide variants, short indels,
and structural variations but also mid-range (10bp - 300bp) indels such as 
internal tandem duplications and viral sequence integrations).

For RNA sequencing analysis, Genomon performs sensitive and accurate detection of 
gene fusions, cancer specific splicing changes.
